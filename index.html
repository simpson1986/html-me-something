<p>It was 10 years since the last time I drove my car. 
I would go out to the garage just to get in the car,and remember the times driving her in highschool. My Galaxie
was my first real car. One day I was driving and blew the engine. It would sit in my parents garage for next 
ten years. </p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>One day I was cleaning my parents garage. I push my car out to get it out of the way. It had years worth of dust,
    so decide to wipe it down. After that I picture me driving it. I was recently engage an thought how cool it would
    be to use in the wedding. Finding parts for it, would be challange in it self. I spent
    many hours hunting down everything I needed. It was all or nothing at that point. I remember driving hours to
    get the parts I needed late at night just to make sure they did not get sold the next morning. Lucky 
    my soon to be wife was always up for a adventure, because she knew how much it ment to me
