<p>It was 10 years since the last time I drove my car. 
I would go out to the garage just to get in the car,and remember the times driving her in highschool. My Galaxie
was my first real car. One day I was driving and blew the engine. It would sit in my parents garage for next 
ten years. </p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>One day I was cleaning my parents garage. I push my car out to get it out of the way. It had years worth of dust,
    so decide to wipe it down. After that I picture me driving it. I was recently engage an thought how cool it would
    be to use in the wedding. Finding parts for it, would be challange in it self. I spent
    many hours hunting down everything I needed. It was all or nothing at that point. I remember driving hours to
    get the parts I needed late at night just to make sure they did not get sold the next morning. Lucky 
    my soon to be wife was always up for a adventure, because she knew how much it ment to me
</p>
<h2>Out With The Bad. In With The Good</h2>
<p>I got what I needed. Now was the fun times. Taking apart a car from the 60's, I thought would have years of 
    build up on the bolts. I was surprised how smooth everything went. Of course there would be small issues 
but they never out weigh the memories i have of my dad, and brother helping along the way. We got the engine out with no major 
issues. Know was the fun part. It was time to tear it apart. Couple weeks later everything was ready to be reinstall.
