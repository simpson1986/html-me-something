    <h2>One Day</h2>
    <img class="picedit"  src="img/first.jpg"alt ="1965 ford galaxie"/>
<p> It was 10 years since the last time I drove my car. 
I would go out to the garage just to get in the car,and remember the times driving her in highschool. My Galaxie
was my first real car. One day I was driving and blew the engine. It would sit in my parents garage for next 
ten years.One day I was cleaning my parents garage. I push my car out to get it out of the way. It had years worth of dust,
so decide to wipe it down.After that I picture me driving it. </p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p> I was recently engage an thought how cool it would
    be to use in the wedding. Finding parts for it, would be challange in it self. I spent
    many hours hunting down everything I needed. It was all or nothing at that point. I remember driving hours to
    get the parts I needed late at night just to make sure they did not get sold the next morning. Lucky 
    my soon to be wife was always up for a adventure, because she knew how much it ment to me. I was even able to find
    the bodyparts I needed.

<h2>Out With The Bad. In With The Good</h2>

<p> I got what I needed. Now was the fun times. Taking apart a car from the 60's, I thought would have years of 
    build up on the bolts. I was surprised how smooth everything went. Of course there would be small issues 
but they never out weigh the memories i have of my dad, and brother helping along the way. We got the engine out with no major 
issues. Now was the fun part. It was time to tear it apart. Couple weeks later everything was ready to be reinstall.

<h2>Its Alive</h2>

<p> We got the engine in with few hiccups. I hook everything up, pour some gas in the carb and tryed starting it.
    First issue was the aftermarket starter wouldn't engage the fly wheel. I got a different one and work perfect.
    Next was had bad igintion system. Called Summit Racing, and had a new one in few days. I turn the key, and it tryed to start!
    I called my dad down so he could turn the key while dump some gas in it. Vroom! The demon was awake! She purr with 
    an additude. Best sound I heard for awhile. I remember that day like it was yesterday. Very bittersweet. 
    All this work finally paid off. It was also the same day my grandma pass away. It gave me time to feel 
     some joy, and get our mind off of life for a second. Finish up with the engine, then did the brakes. After that took it around
     the block. I had other issues come up, but lucky nothing bad!

<h2>The Moral Of The Story</h2>
<img class="picedit" src="img/wedding.jpg"alt ="1965 ford galaxie"/>
<p>I was working on the car till a couple days before our wedding. I had times of high stress, but wrote that off
    as wedding fears. It's easy to quit, give up, and never look back. This was my goal. This was going to happen.
    Somedays I would walk away. The next day I'm eager to finish it up. Never doubht yourself. I didn't, and 
    my car was at our wedding!
